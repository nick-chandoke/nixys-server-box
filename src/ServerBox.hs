{- | Routes may either fail with a response ('short',) or fail such that they try another route ('next'.) If a route fails with a response, then the computation short circuits immediately; (other failures that may have occured had the failure not been there) will occur once that failure is fixed. In other words, RouteArr does not yet support Validations-style error collecting. Obviously, this is under consideration and may be added in a later release.

=== Example

@
import Network.Socket (SockAddr(..)) -- in the package called "network"
let route1 =  'onPath' (=="\/path1") >>>
              ('onMethod' (==methodGet)  >>> constA (responseLBS ok200 [] "You're getting page 1!"))
          <+> ('onMethod' (==methodPost) >>> constA (responseLBS ok200 [] "You're posting to page 1!"))
    guardIP = guardA -- return error response if not from a particular IP address
        (responseLBS forbidden403 [] "Banned IP address.")
        (\\(remoteHost -> SockAddrInet _ addr) -> addr `elem` bannedAddrs)
    route2 = guardIP >>> static "/approot/filesystem/"
in 'stdwarp'
    Nothing -- no TLS; we're doing HTTP only
    (setPort 8080 stdSettings)
    id -- no middleware
    (responseLBS notImplemented501 mempty mempty)
    (route1 \<+\> route2) -- try route1; if it deferrs to route2, then try route2. If route2 deferrs, then respond with the above HTTP 501.
@

This translates to the following routing:

1. If path is @/path1@, respond with a "getting" or "posting" response on the respective methods.
2. If path is not @/path1@, or method is neither GET nor POST, then check if the IP address is banned; if so, return a response saying so; else serve files from the local filesystem.

--
-- For example, to serve on an AWS S3-compatible CDN, one may do
-- @let cdn = (\\p -\> "https:\/\/mybucket.somecdn.com" \<\> p) in staticOn@, which, would redirect, /e.g./ "\/\/mysite.com\/path1" to "https:\/\/mybucket.somecdn.com\/path1". *Note that the static URL does not end with a slash.* This doesn't always need to be the case, but you must always consider that the path being transformed (the @p@ lambda variable, in this example) /does/ begin with a leading slash!

-- === Suggestions
--
-- * have all links â /e.g./ @href@ and @src@ attributes â point directly to the static resources on the CDN
-- * you'll almost always want to use with @onMethod (==methodGet)@
-- * if you really are using a CDN to host all your (non-dynamically-generated) webpages (like you /should/,) then be sure to <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139394?hl=en let search engines know that the pages are really yours>, rather than you just linking to someone else's page! Also, set access to /Public/ in your DigitalOcean spaces dashboard!

-- | The most common way to route: by URL. This uses a trie for efficient storage and fast lookup. Namely, composing routes by @(\<\>)@\/@(\<|\>)@ is linearly complex, but routing on paths via a trie is probably of a logarithmic order.
--
-- === The Trie
--
-- * All items in the trie represent absolute URLs. None should lead nor end with a slash, since that'd be redundant. These are necessary preconditions.
-- * *It is recommended to 'normalize' your @Request@ before using @routeByPath@.*
--
-- Note that this only works on completely non-abstract URL paths; no variables are allowed in the URL, as the trie works on @ByteString@ only. Thus in order to use parameterized URLs, use query parameters rather than variable path segments. I know that's not commonly done, so if that's bad practice (other than "it's bad because the W3C gods decreed that query is for non-hierarchical data and paths /are/ for such data"), please let me know.
--
-- Also note that you might be able to use a trie to route variable paths, by using 'Trie.lookupBy' or 'Trie.match', but such methods quickly become messy, thus undermining the simple nature of ServerBox. Also, such methods are not general. However, if you really want parameterized paths with logarithmic lookup, it may be possible.
--
-- === Why Using Query Parameters as an Alternative to Parameterized Paths (Usually) Works
--
-- 1. @POST@ parameters go in request headers, so query parameters are not part of the URL, and are thus not considerable here.
-- 2. @GET@ parameters are good for bookmarking, so they /should/ be a part of the URL as normal.
-- 3. This should not be a concern as far as being indexed by search engines, since one can use the @canonical@ meta tag, which would be dynamically generated to reference a normalized URL, thus allowing /e.g./ hackage package pages or wikipedia article pages to be indexed non-redundantly.
-- 4. For dynamic pages that do not exist (e.g. a parameterized URL whose parameters are invalid, like a URL for a package that does not exist), dynamically generate the page with a <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93710 @noindex@ meta tag or response header> so that crawlers will ignore them.
--
-- Thus most parameterized URLs can be parameterized by queries non-redundantly & canonically so that they can be bookmarked and crawled or not, thus being effectively equivalent to path-parameterized URLs. The only variety of URLs for which the variable-path\/query-param isomorphism breaks-down is those of arbitrarily-nested parameters, /i.e./ @â¯/param1/â¯/paramN@ for arbitrary /N/.
--
-- === SEO
--
-- For SEO, @routeByPath@ works with unary URLs only, considering that <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en hierarchical relations are important for SEO> (see the section "Navigation is important for search engines"). The parameter obviously goes in the query. This works for hackage and wikipedia, since articles aren't hierarchical. Note, in the <https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FkXf1NMLRBDRD0-82WWHYCu7_nHxCzkUaMDFDAuGiFRYIrtgO3wqSJdtSFhpnyu3yeE=w314 above linked article's example>, that there's a false hierarchy: they're using time periods as hierarchies. Because hierarchies are defined by a total ordering on any branch, "news" and time period, or "price-guides" and time period cannot be hierarchically related, because (these) prepositional phrases compose commutatively, /e.g./ "news 1948" has identical meaning as "1948 news." Be careful to not assume false orderings.
